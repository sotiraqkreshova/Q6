When Chuck Norris falls in water, Chuck Norris doesn't get wet. Water gets Chuck Norris.
Chuck Norris doesnt read books. He stares them down until he gets the information he wants.
Chuck Norris does not sleep. He waits.
Chuck Norris has never blinked in his entire life. Never.
Time waits for no man. Unless that man is Chuck Norris.
