I read the string from "input.txt" file
Then I loop on all the string.
I initialize a stack "word" and keep pushing chars in it as long as I'm not done with the word.
Once I am done.. I pop all the stack items into another string 'str_reversed' until the stack is empty

Then I put the other characters in the string 'str_reversed' until I start with another word and so on until I am done with the entire string.
